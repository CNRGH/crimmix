ABSTRACT={Multi-omics data integration is one of the major challenges in the era of precision medicine. Considerable work has been done with the advent of high-throughput studies, which have enabled the data access for downstream analyses. To improve the clinical outcome prediction, a gamut of software tools has been developed. This review outlines the progress done in the field of multi-omics integration and comprehensive tools developed so far in this field. Further, we discuss the integration methods to predict patient survival at the end of the review.}

Based on a covariance optimization criterion, MCIA simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.",

abstract = "Male hamsters (30 per group) were fed five different semi-purified diets ad libitum. The diets, containing 30% of energy (en%) as fat, differed in their dietary fat composition (specified fatty acids exchanged at 10 en%) and were fed for 4 weeks. The five fatty acids compared in mixed triglycerides were elaidic acid (C18:1 9t), vaccenic acid (C18:1 11t), their cis-counterpart oleic acid (C18:1 9c), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA; C8:0 and C10:0), and palmitic acid (C16:0). Compared with oleic acid, dietary MCFA and palmitic acid tended to increase blood cholesterol levels in the hamsters. The effect of elaidic and vaccenic acid on blood cholesterol did not differ from that of oleic acid. When elaidic acid and vaccenic acids were compared directly, the ratio of LDL/HDL-cholesterol in plasma was significantly higher in hamsters fed vaccenic acid than in those fed elaidic acid, and elaidic acid was incorporated at low levels, but more efficiently than vaccenic acid at the sn-2 position of platelet phospholipids. Biological consequences of this low incorporation are considered unlikely as levels of arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) and docosohexaenoic acid (C22:6 n-3) in the platelet phospholipids of all dietary groups did not differ. With respect to the effect on the LDL/HDL-cholesterol ratio, elaidic acid may be preferable to vaccenic acid. We conclude that this animal study does not provide evidence for the suggestion, based on epidemiological observations, that elaidic acid would be more detrimental to cardiovascular risk than vaccenic acid."
